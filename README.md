## Pre-push hook (Optional)
We recommand you enable the pre-push hook if wish to commit to this repository.
This will run checks before the code is pushed to the remote.

The pre-push hook is run via [lefthook](https://lefthook.dev).

### MacOS

brew install lefthook

```
go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest

After installed lefthook, update git hook to use lefthook:
```
# run at project root
left hook install
```
Then you are good to go!
The pre-push checks will be envoked when you do `git push`.

If the checks didn't pass, the push will be blocked.

To temporary by pass the pre-push check and push:
```
git push origin --no-verify
```
To disable pre-push action until re-open it:
```
left hook uninstall
```
